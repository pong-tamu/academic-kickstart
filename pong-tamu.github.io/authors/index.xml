      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rob Hetland is a Professor in the Dept of Oceanography, Texas A&amp;amp;M University. His research is focused on numerical simulation of flow in estuarine, coastal, and continental shelf environments; applications include examining plankton bloom dynamics, formation and destruction of continental shelf hypoxia, and real-time surface current forecasting.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I grew up in Seattle, but headed east of the mountains to attend &lt;a href=&#34;www.whitman.edu&#34;&gt;Whitman College&lt;/a&gt;, where I received a Bachelor of Arts in Physics and minor in mathematics in 2005. After college, I lived in Washington, D.C., for most of a year before returning to Seattle to attend the &lt;a href=&#34;www.washington.edu&#34;&gt;University of Washington&lt;/a&gt; in my hometown. I received a Masters of Science in &lt;a href=&#34;amath.washington.edu&#34;&gt;Applied Mathematics&lt;/a&gt; in June 2007, and a Ph.D. in &lt;a href=&#34;me.washington.edu&#34;&gt;Mechanical Engineering&lt;/a&gt; in June 2012. I am currently an Assistant Research Professor in &lt;a href=&#34;ocean.tamu.edu&#34;&gt;Oceanography&lt;/a&gt; at Texas A&amp;amp;M University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of academics, I have always been active in the outdoors. I began climbing mountains when I was 15 and have been doing so ever since. In high school I also started playing lacrosse, which I played all through high school and college and hope to pick up again soon. Running has been a part of my life since about 1998. I&#39;ve run numerous half marathons, and completed my first marathon in October 2006 (Marine Corps) and second marathon in April 2009 (Big Sur). I also try to participate in an ultra run once a year somewhere around the West Coast with some good friends.&lt;/p&gt;
