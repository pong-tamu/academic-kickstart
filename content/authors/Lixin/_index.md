I am a coastal physical oceanographer specializing in submesoscale (0.1-10 km) processes with an interest in interdisciplinary research linking fluid dynamics to biogeochemistry in the coastal environment. I am also a big fan of turbulent and mixing processes in coastal zones. I use a hierarchy of ocean modeling tools, including [ROMS](https://www.myroms.org/) (RANS), [DIABLO](https://github.com/johnryantaylor/DIABLO) (LES), [DEDALUS](http://dedalus-project.org/) (CFD solver in spectral methods), and [GOTM](http://www.gotm.net/) (turbulence model), to combine with theories to explore coastal oceans. I received my Ph.D. in oceanography under the supervision of [Prof. Robert Hetland](https://ocean.tamu.edu/people/profiles/faculty/hetlandrobert.html) at [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/) and currently work with [Prof. Leif Thomas](https://profiles.stanford.edu/leif-thomas) as a postdoctoral research fellow at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/).
