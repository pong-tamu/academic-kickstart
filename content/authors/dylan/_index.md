Dylan received his B.S. in Civil Engineering from the University of Maine in 2019. During his undergrad, he worked on several coastal engineering projects, including: 1) Assessing the viability of vegetation farms as a solution to coastal erosion in southern Maine, 2) Performing field work for the Sensing Storm Surge Project, which implemented a citizen science network to study storm surge in several Maine estuaries, and 3) Conducting laboratory experiments to study the hydrodynamic and turbulent characteristics of floating oyster cages. He was also an NSF REU student during summer 2018 at Texas A&M University, where he used ROMS outputs to study salinity structure in Copano Bay, an unsteady estuary along the Gulf Coast. After joining PONG in January 2020, his research focuses on the SUNRISE NSF-NERC project, which aims to understand the influence of near-inertial and submesoscale motions on turbulent mixing in the upper ocean.
